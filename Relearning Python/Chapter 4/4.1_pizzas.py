# Store three pizza names n a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
# Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza.
# Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza.

# list of pizzas
pizzas = ['Mushroom', 'Pepperoni', 'Sausage']

# for loop
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(pizza)
    print("I like " + pizza + " pizza.\n")
    
print('Love pizza!')
