Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three
names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for
each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to
name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each
personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
